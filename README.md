# Applied-Data-Science-Final-Project
Project Goal: Trying to understand what predicts admission yield (percent of admitted students who choose to enroll at a university) using various features like SAT scores, tuition, demographics, etc.

## Quick Start
  
**Clone the Repository:**
```

   git clone https://github.com/ruangkawprc/Applied-Data-Science-Final-Project.git
```

## Dataset
Source: IPEDS — Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumithbhongale/american-university-data-ipeds-dataset
Scope of Data
- 1,500+ U.S. colleges and universities
- 130+ columns, including: Admissions & enrollment numbers, Tuition & fees (in-state, out-of-state), SAT/ACT scores, Racial/ethnic breakdown, Geographic info & control info (public vs. private, urban vs. rural)

## Our Goals
We had three primary goals going into this project. Namely, we wanted to:
1. Predict acceptance and yield rates for U.S. colleges and universities.2
2. Identify which features (e.g., SAT scores, tuition, race demographics, school type) drive these outcomes.
3. Provide insights that can help: Institutions optimize recruitment strategies & Students/families better understand school dynamics and ‘fit’

Simply put, we are hoping to shift the focus from “Who gets into a university?” to “Who actually shows up — and why?”
